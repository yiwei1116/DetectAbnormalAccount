A project that simulat streaming data scenario.
The scenario is about 10 Million daily accounts. 
There has been some reports of multiple people in different countries sharing the same account id and password (this is a naive use case, 
a website with a good authentication system can usually detect this) and because of this fraudulent behavior the company you work for is loosing a lot of money.
It is the solution to fix these problems.
